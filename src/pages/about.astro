      <p>
        Entangled Packets was created to bridge the knowledge gap between traditional networking expertise and quantum computing concepts. 
        As quantum networking emerges as a future industry direction, there's a growing need for network engineers to understand quantum 
        principles without requiring a physics degree.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to make quantum computing and networking concepts accessible to network engineering professionals. 
        We believe that as quantum technologies continue to develop, networking professionals will play a crucial role in 
        implementing and maintaining quantum networks.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why Quantum Computing for Network Engineers?</h2>
      <p>
        Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in how we process information. For network engineers, understanding 
        quantum principles is becoming increasingly important for several reasons:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Quantum Networks are Coming:</strong> Major technology companies and research institutions are already 
          building the first quantum networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Transformation:</strong> Quantum computing will fundamentally change network security approaches, 
          making current encryption methods vulnerable while enabling new quantum-secure protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Career Development:</strong> Early expertise in quantum networking principles will be highly valuable as 
          the technology matures and enters commercial applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conceptual Foundation:</strong> Understanding quantum principles helps network engineers prepare for the 
          architectural changes quantum networks will bring.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on explaining quantum concepts with direct connections to networking principles. Rather than diving deep 
        into quantum physics mathematics, we emphasize practical implications and analogies that make sense to networking professionals.
