# Active Context: Entangled Packets

## Current Focus
- Setting up the initial Astro project structure
- Implementing the core design system using Tailwind CSS
- Creating the basic page templates and navigation
- Establishing the content structure for quantum computing articles

## Recent Changes
- Created the Memory Bank structure
- Defined the project brief with detailed requirements
- Selected Astro as the framework with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Decided on a custom Markdown-based content management approach

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Astro project with Tailwind CSS integration
2. Create basic project structure and component architecture
3. Implement minimal design system (colors, typography, spacing)
4. Develop core templates (home, article listing, article detail)
5. Set up initial content for quantum computing fundamentals

## Active Decisions
- Using Astro for its performance and content-focused approach
- Implementing a custom Markdown-based content solution rather than a headless CMS
- Focusing initial content on quantum computing fundamentals
- Emphasizing a minimal, clean design aesthetic
- Prioritizing performance and accessibility from the beginning
